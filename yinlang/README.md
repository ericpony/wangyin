# The Yin Programming Language


### Introduction

I started to design a new programming language, which tries to solve the
following problems:

- Most languages fail to learn from some historical mistakes
- Most languages have a religious following and an over-enthusiastic community, which prevents them from correcting their mistakes
- Some languages do too little for programmers, some languages do too much
- Some languages provide too little abstraction, some languages provide too much
- Some languages focus too little on usability, some languages focus too much on usability and not much on everything else
- Some languages learned too little from mathematics and logics, some languages learned too much
- Some languages infer too little about types, some languages infer too much


Solving these problems will need lots of inputs from programmers' experiences.
You are welcome to follow my development and let me know your experiences and
perspectives, so that I can make the best decision.



### Current state

The language is in a design stage, so please don't expect it to be usable right
now. Many design decisions are already made, but many still remain. If you want
to learn how to design and implement a language, this might be a good place to
look.



### Implemented features

- basic types (integers, floats, arrays, records)
- primitive operators (arithmetic)
- first-class functions (closures)
- type system (incomplete)



### Implemented facilities

- parser
- interpreter
- type checker



### Still missing

- testing framework
- compiler
- runtime system
